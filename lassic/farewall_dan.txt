Dan,
I, sadly, did not get a chance to work closely with you,
However, from the brief conversations we did have (that lunch @ Azrieli comes to mind),
from your questions and comments in meetings, and just your general presence I can sense you are one
of the best. Not just a pro programmer (as evident from all the projects you contributed to), but
a humble and kind person who is a pleasure to be around.
I wish we had more time to work together, but who knows, the future is always surprising!

I wish you the best time in whatever you do, and all the success in the world.
