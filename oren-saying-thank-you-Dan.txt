Dear Dan,

We wanted to inform you, with all seriousness, that you're awesome.
We wanted to to let you know that you're already an accomplished young man, and we believe you've got a bright future ahead.
We wanted to say that you made a difference in every system and feature you've taken.
We wanted to say that it was amazing to work alongside you, and have you here.
We wanted to say that by saying "We", I mean "I".

I wanted to thank you on behalf of "We", as due to your kind attitude and highest professionalism you brought the team together in many situations (just ask Goldi, Itamar and Nathan).

Thank you so much and good luck in the army, Dan, we're going to miss you here!



p.s. you might have some moments of boredom, so I gathered these links for you:
