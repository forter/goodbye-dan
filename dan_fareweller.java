Dan,

Even as someone who hadn't gotten to work with you much, your talets were still very noticeable. Intelligent, dilligent,  calm, mature and unintimidated by work. You will definitely be a huge asset to any project you'll work on.

I'm certain you have a very bright future ahead of you. Make sure to have a lot of fun in the army, and who knows, maybe we'll get to work again at sometime in the future. I sure hope so.

P.S.
I didn't really write Java code here because I wanted to keep it short =)

Re'em
